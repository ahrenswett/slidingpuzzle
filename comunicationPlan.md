Communication is the foundation for every good team. Below are some of our guidelines.

1. If anyone is having a block in their project for longer than 15 minutes it is impoortant that we talk about it with others in the group.

2. At the end of day we will give group standup and do a code review so that everyone is on the same page.

3. Slack will be used to update group about any life confilicts and how they are blocking forward movment on project. This way the group can figure out how to help.

4. It is imparitive that everyone be able to speak frealy yet respectfully without fear of judgment or retaliation. That each person's views are heard and thoughtfully considered.

5. Dont be a jerk about it :)
